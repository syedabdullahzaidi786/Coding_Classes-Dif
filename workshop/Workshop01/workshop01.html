      HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the standard markup
      language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML provides the
      structure for web content by using a system of tags and attributes to
      define the various elements within a document, such as headings,
      paragraphs, images, links, and more. It works in conjunction with other
      web technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and
      JavaScript for interactivity, forming the backbone of the World Wide Web.
